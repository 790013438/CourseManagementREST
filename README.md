# REST web services
## Creating RESTful web services using Jersey
> We will create a web service for the Course Management example that we have been developing in this book. The web service will have methods to get all courses and create a new course. To keep the example simple, we will not write the data access code (you could use the JDBC or JDO APIs that we have learnt in the previous chapters), but will hardcode the data.
